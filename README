CEL GPU LOG MAP DECODER README 

The GPU Log MAP Decoder is a first approach to speed up the log-Map algorithm
for a 8 state convolutional code derived from the LTE turbocode. It is implemented
in C and OpenCL. 

The software is divided in two parts. The C implementation that generates a random
signal, initializes the OpenCL Framework, copies databuffers to the GPU and starts
the OpenCL kernels on the GPU. The sourcecode is found in decoder.c and decoder.h
DecoderConfig.h has all relevant constant definition, e.g. packet length and coderate.

The second part are the OpenCL Kernels that implement the decoder algorithm on the
GPU. 

This Version was tested with the NVIDIA CUDA 5.5 SDK and NVIDIA driver 319.76 for 
linux. An OpenCL installation is necessary to compile and run the "CEL GPU Log-MAP Decoder".

usage is 
opendecoder [number of runs]

The CEL GPU Log-MAP Decoder then will generate a random vector of LLRs, decode 
the frame. The time to copy the LLRs to the GPU, decoding them and copying them back
will be measured. A mean value will be calculated over the number of runs to 
compensate for non-realtime behavior of the operating system.
